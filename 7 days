Yes, but with conditions. You can build a basic working prototype of a video streaming pipeline in 7 days if you focus only on the essentials, skip microservices for now, and rely on existing tools and managed services. Here's how to do it:

Scope: What You Can Do in 7 Days

You can build a minimal version of your system that:

Accepts video uploads or live input (e.g., RTMP stream)

Transcodes the videos using FFmpeg

Serves videos using HLS

Streams to multiple viewers via NGINX + HLS

Includes a simple frontend using React + Video.js

Handles basic user metadata (hardcoded or simple DB)

Uses a single server (e.g., AWS EC2) or Docker


> This won't be production-ready, microservices-based, or fully auto-scalable—but it will work.

7-Day Plan (Prototype Mode)

Day 1: Setup Environment & Learn Basics

Learn how HLS works (video chunking)

Install FFmpeg, NGINX with HLS module (or use Docker image)

Set up a test input stream or file


Day 2: Video Ingestion & Transcoding

Use FFmpeg to ingest and convert videos to HLS format

Output .m3u8 playlist and .ts segments

Store them in a local directory or S3


Day 3: NGINX Configuration

Serve .m3u8 + .ts via NGINX

Test video playback locally via browser

Enable basic caching and HTTP config tuning


Day 4: Frontend with React + Video.js

Build a minimal React frontend

Load and play .m3u8 playlist in the player

Add minimal UI (start/stop, status)


Day 5: Simple Backend (Optional)

Use Node.js or Python Flask to serve metadata (title, stream URL)

Hardcoded or use SQLite/PostgreSQL

Simple API: /videos, /watch/:id


Day 6: Testing with Multiple Viewers

Open multiple browser tabs/devices to simulate viewers

Use ab (ApacheBench) or wrk to simulate 1000 HTTP requests

Tune NGINX: increase worker_connections, use sendfile, keepalive


Day 7: Wrap Up & Demo

Deploy to a single VPS (e.g., AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean)

Optional: set up domain + TLS via Let's Encrypt

Document how it works

Record a demo for future use or pitch

Requirements to Pull This Off in 7 Days

You know how to use Linux CLI, Git, and Docker (or willing to learn fast)

You’re comfortable with Node.js or Python for APIs

You can learn fast and follow tutorials

You’re okay with shortcuts and some hardcoded logic (for now)



---

What You Should Skip (for now):

Microservices

Kubernetes

Auto-scaling

CDN integration

CI/CD pipelines

Full user auth
